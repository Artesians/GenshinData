# GenshinData
Repository containing the game data for the game Genshin Impact.

This repository is a work in progress between Falzar#4798 and Dimbreath#0424. Expect some things to change. Not sure if this is going to keep getting updated since it's a lot of work for mostly nothing.

The objective of this repository is to provide people with data to work on APIs, bots, websites, contributing to wikis, etc. Not for anything else. This won't be updated with unreleased data, go search somewhere else or do it yourself.

This is not your source of "leaks" to get some shiny internet points, nothing here points about anything that might happen in the future and all the data is from live versions, not beta. Stop guessing shit. Stop guessing rarities of unreleased characters and whatnot and attributing credits these guesses on other people.

If you use this it'd be really appreciated if you credited :)
