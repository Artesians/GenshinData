Repository containing the game data for the game Genshin Impact.

This repository is a work between Falzar#4798 and Dimbreath#0424. Not sure if this is going to keep getting updated since it's a lot of work for nothing.

The objective of this repository is to provide people with data to work on APIs, bots, websites, contributing to wikis, etc. not for anything else. This won't be updated with unreleased data so learn to do that yourself if you want it. There's already enough people as it is using this data to become "leakers" and not even bother sourcing the actual place where they're taking it from because people barely (to not say almost never) credits and it feels like an insult to the time and work we put into this and all the stuff you see around on social media (which also goes unrecognized.)

This is not your source of "leaks" to get some shiny internet points, nothing here points about anything that might happen in the future and all the data is from live versions, not beta. Stop guessing shit. Stop guessing rarities of unreleased characters and whatnot and attributing credits of these guesses of yours on other people.

If you use this it'd be really appreciated if you *properly* credited :)
